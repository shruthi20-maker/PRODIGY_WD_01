    <h1>Some Cool Stories</h1>
    <div class="flex-columns">
      <p>Sant Jordi (Saint George) is the patron saint of Catalonia, and his legend is deeply woven into the fabric of Barcelona. 
        According to the tale, Sant Jordi saved a princess from a dragon, and from the dragon's blood sprouted a rose bush. 
        Today, this legend is celebrated every year on April 23rd, known as La Diada de Sant Jordi (St. George's Day). 
        The day is marked by the exchange of books and roses, transforming the city into a vibrant marketplace filled with stands selling flowers and books.</p>

      <p>One of the most unique cultural traditions in Catalonia, including Barcelona, is the building of human towers, known as "castells.
         These towers can reach up to ten levels high and are constructed by groups called "colles". 
         The tradition dates back to the 18th century and has been recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 
         The process requires strength, balance, courage, and teamwork, making it a spectacular sight during festivals and competitions.</p>

      <p>The Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic) is the heart of old Barcelona, with narrow medieval streets full of history and mystery. 
         One notable story is the legend of El Call, the Jewish Quarter. 
         During medieval times, it was one of the most important Jewish communities in Spain. 
         Hidden within its labyrinthine streets are remnants of this past, including the ancient Sinagoga Major, one of Europe's oldest synagogues. 
         Another gem is the Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, a peaceful square bearing scars from the Spanish Civil War.</p>
